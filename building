OK so I started with a Kadet Senior RC aircraft. Then I converted it to an electric engine and then reconfigured it as a tail dragger.
I have a Futaba FP-T-7UAF radio system and updated an Arducopter autopilot controller to "Plane" mode. I have added a gps to make it 
fully autonomous using APM Planner and Mission Planner. I have a wireless video camera on board 
and plan on this being a stable camera platform with slow flight characteristics.
  At present I am still in the wiring and programming mode and spring is a long way offf so I am thinking
  of building a set of skis and maybe a set of floats. This should be one awesome machine when it all comes together.
  Meanwhile - Happy New Year.
